# house-of-gift-cards

A project made for Code Fellows 301 by [Stephen Carney](http://github.com/scarney3), [Natalie Chow](http://github.com/xxnatc), [Sabrina Tee](http://github.com/sabbyt) & [Patrick Yau](https://github.com/patyau).

House of Gift Cards is a streamlined app that aims to cut down the time and energy individually spent on giving; thereby fulfilling more requests and realizing the maximum benefit of these claims. This centralized platform will allow easy collection of the data, allow visualization of individual impact, and the total impact we have made as a community. Additionally, this system will connect the requestor with the donor, to establish a deeper, long-lasting connection beyond just a meaningful contribution.
